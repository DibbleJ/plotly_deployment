# Belly Button Biodiversity
## Overview
  In an effort to find the most suitable flavor for meat alternatives, Roza and her team are investigating belly-button bacterial data from many volunteers. The information for each volunteer is presented in this dynamic javascript dashboard. The Operational Taxonimic Unit (OTU) is the terminology used to classify bacteria in this context. The interactive dashboard can be found here: https://dibblej.github.io/plotly_deployment/
## Results
  There are 3 visualizations that are presented.
  - A horizontal bar chart displays the top 10 bacterial cultures that are present in descending order of quantity. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40553064/126882841-40f1dcb0-a951-44ad-892c-ade3f52c262b.png)

  - A Bubble chart displays the kind and quantity of all of the OTUs present. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/40553064/126882854-e1500d99-29d5-45c7-936b-404a4c8a06d9.png)

## Summary
